## Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of Configuration as Code for Terraform Cloud, enabling teams to manage their Terraform Cloud workspaces, variable sets, and organizational settings through version-controlled configuration files.

## Key Features

- **Workspace Management**: Automated creation and configuration of Terraform Cloud workspaces
- **Variable Sets**: Centralized management of environment variables and Terraform variables
- **Team Management**: Automated team and permission configuration
- **Policy Integration**: Seamless integration with Sentinel policies
- **Version Control**: Full GitOps workflow for infrastructure configuration changes

## Technologies Used

- **HashiCorp Terraform**: Infrastructure as Code tool
- **Terraform Cloud**: Managed Terraform service
- **HCL**: HashiCorp Configuration Language
- **Git**: Version control system
- **CI/CD**: Automated deployment pipelines

## Architecture

The solution follows a modular approach where:
1. Configuration files define the desired state
2. Terraform providers interact with Terraform Cloud APIs
3. Changes are applied through automated pipelines
4. State is managed centrally in Terraform Cloud

## Impact

This approach enables:
- **Consistency**: Standardized workspace configurations across environments
- **Scalability**: Easy replication of setups for new projects
- **Auditability**: Complete change history through version control
- **Compliance**: Automated policy enforcement and governance
