## Overview

This project implements comprehensive security governance for AWS S3 using HashiCorp Sentinel policies, ensuring that S3 buckets are configured according to security best practices and compliance requirements.

## Key Security Controls

- **Encryption Enforcement**: Mandatory encryption at rest and in transit
- **Public Access Prevention**: Automated blocking of public read/write access
- **Versioning Requirements**: Enforced versioning for data protection
- **Lifecycle Management**: Automated data lifecycle and retention policies
- **Access Logging**: Mandatory access logging configuration
- **MFA Delete**: Multi-factor authentication for object deletion

## Technologies Used

- **HashiCorp Sentinel**: Policy as Code framework
- **AWS S3**: Cloud storage service
- **Terraform**: Infrastructure as Code tool
- **AWS IAM**: Identity and Access Management
- **CloudTrail**: AWS audit logging service

## Governance Framework

### Policy Categories

1. **Security Policies**
   - Encryption requirements
   - Access control validation
